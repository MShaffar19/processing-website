## Project Leads

[Ben Fry](https://benfry.com/) and [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/) started Processing in Spring 2001 and continue to obsessively work on it. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with [Dan Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/), who formally joined as a third project lead.

## Developers

- [Andres Colubri](https://andrescolubri.net/) (Boston), OpenGL / Video
- [Elie Zananiri](http://prisonerjohn.com/) (New York), Contributed Libraries / Tools
- [Samuel Pottinger](https://github.com/sampottinger) (San Francisco), Processing Core

## Libraries and Tools

The core Processing software is augmented by [libraries](https://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/) and [tools](https://www.processing.org/reference/tools/) contributed through the community. These inventive extensions are a bright future for the project. We have a list of Contributed Libraries and Contributed Tools posted online. These contributions can't be underestimated. For example, see how Karsten Schmidt (London) has transformed Processing through the toxiclibs library and how Damien Di Fede (Austin) has extended the project into programming sound through his minim library.

## Website and Design

[Design Systems International](https://designsystems.international/) designed and built the current website and the new Processing family of logos through a year of dedicated volunteer work. A remarkable group of volunteers converted all of the content from the prior Processing website to the new formats. A hearty round of applause for:
- Tetsu Kondo
- Mark Webster
- Lionel Radisson
- Chris Coleman
- Justin Gitlin
- Seenahm Suriyasat
- Shobhit Sharma
- Karan Dudeja
- Mark Hancock
